1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  A remote repository would be great when I'm either working from a different computer, 
  or for when someone else wants to make changes to the repository.

2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  Because that way, I can choose wether or not I want to add the changes to my github repository 
  to my local git repository.
