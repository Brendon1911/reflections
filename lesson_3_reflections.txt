1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  A remote repository would be great when I'm either working from a different computer, 
  or for when someone else wants to make changes to the repository.

2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  Because that way, I can choose wether or not I want to add the changes to my github repository 
  to my local git repository.

3. Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. 
When would you use one instead of another?

  Forks - Forks are clones of other people's repository's which is exclusive to Github.
          You would use forks when you don't have access to clone someone elses repository.

  Clones - A clone is an exact duplicate of a repository.
           You would use this when you do have access to a repository.

  Branches - Branches are commits which branch off of the main line of commits.
             These are great for when you want to change something to the main project without 
             interfering with the master branch.

4. What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

  The benefit is that if you're moving on to a state where you don't have internet access, 
  having the last known state of the remote stored locally is a great way to allow you to 
  continue to add to the project.

5. How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, 
and what would be harder?

  I wouldn't collaborate without Git ot Github.

  It would make everything much more difficult.
