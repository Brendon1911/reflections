1. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

    It creates a repository in the folder you're working in. You need to use It
    so that you have somewhere to store commits.

2. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

    The staging area is different in as much as it gives you a chance to actually
    see what's planned on being commited, before commiting it.

3. How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

    The staging area is a great way to keep track of the files you've made changes to that you 
    want to commit, before you commit those changes.

4. What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

    Branches are awesome for testing different things in a project, without disrupting the main
    project.

5. How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

    The diagrams make it easy to visualize what the master branch is and how all other branches 
    branch off of it.
    
    This also makes it easy to see what the other branches relationships are with the 
    master branch

6. What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?

    Merging two branches together is a great way to introduce changes you want to apply to The
    main branch without having to insert that change manually.

    Plus, you can always view the previous commits for the other branches through the main branch.

7. What are the pros and cons of Git's automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?
